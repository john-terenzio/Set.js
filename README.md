Set.js
======

A small, fast set implementation inspired by Python.
----------------------------------------------------

Set.js is defines a new Set class which implements unordered, mutable sets in
JavaScript. It can be used on the client or server side (ex. Node.js). Set.js
is inspired by Python sets and implements most of the same functionality. It's
also backed by a full suite of tests using Jasmine.
